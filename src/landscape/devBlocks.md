## Purpose  

To identify blocks of developed land from land cover characteristics. Developed land includes bare ground, paved surfaces, and building footprints, in addition to land within 100 ft of a building (landscaping). Contiguous patches of these land cover types represent blocks of developed land.       

## Data inputs   

- [Land cover](../datasets/landcover.md): to identify tree canopy and impervious or bare land    
- Residence points

## Workflow

### 1. Define developed land  

### 2. Filter and lump targets  

### 3. Classify by area (size)
